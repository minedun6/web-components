A library of pearson web components

## Dependencies
You will need to add the following 3 polyfills, in order for your project to be cross-browser compatible.  These polyfills will need to go between the  `<head>  </head>` tags on the HTML page you want to load the web component on. 

 - **Web Component Loader - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/webcomponentsjs**
 - **ES5 Adapter - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/webcomponentsjs**
 - **Polyfill-io - https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/examples**

       <!-- loads web component polyfills -->
       <head>
           <script src="https://unpkg.com/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@^2/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>
           <script src="https://unpkg.com/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@^2/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js"></script>
           <script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js"></script>
       </head>
       
**Additionally** 
If you prefer not to use a CDN, you can download these polyfills locally with NPM
